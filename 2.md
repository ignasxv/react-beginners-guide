# React Notes fron [react.dev](react.dev/learn)

## Creating and nesting componets
- React apps are made out components
    - **A Component** is a piece of UI that has its own logic and appearence
    - React components are basically JS functions that return markup
        ```tsx
        export default function MyComponent(){
            return (
                <h1>This is a Component</h1>
                <AnotherComponent/>
            );
        }

        function AnotherComponent(){
            return (
                <h2>Another component</h2>
            );
        }
        ```
    - *As a convention Componets must always start with a Capital letter, while HTML tags tags must be lowercase*
    - `expor default` keyword specifies the main component in the file
    - JSX markup is used for convenience 
    - specify css class with `className`
## Conditional rendering

## Responding to events
- You can respond to events by declaring `event handler` functions inside your components
## Hooks
- Functions starting with `use` are called *hooKs*
- Built-in React Hooks
    - State Hooks: lets a componets rememver info like user input
        - `useState()`: declares a state varible that you can update directly
        - `useReducer()`: Allows easier state management in a component with growing complexity, it allows props to be managed in a central reducer function
